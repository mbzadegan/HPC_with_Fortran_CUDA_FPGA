# Mixed-Precision 2D Jacobi on CPU, GPU, and FPGA (HLS)

## Abstract
We implement the 2D Jacobi iterative stencil across three backends: **Fortran + OpenMP (CPU)**, **CUDA (GPU)**, and **FPGA (HLS)**.  
We evaluate **mixed precision (fp64, fp32, fp16/fixed16)** performance and accuracy trade-offs.  
Results show that GPU fp16 achieves significant speedups with modest error, while FPGA synthesis estimates suggest competitive throughput with lower resource usage, highlighting the potential of heterogeneous computing for HPC workloads.

## 1. Introduction
- Motivation: HPC relies on heterogeneous architectures (CPU, GPU, FPGA).  
- Jacobi method: canonical stencil kernel, memory-bound, widely used in PDE solvers.  
- Goal: explore precision vs performance trade-offs across architectures.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Kernel
2D Jacobi stencil, 5-point average:
\[
u^{(t+1)}_{i,j} = \frac{1}{4}(u^{(t)}_{i-1,j} + u^{(t)}_{i+1,j} + u^{(t)}_{i,j-1} + u^{(t)}_{i,j+1})
\]

Boundary: fixed (top edge hot = 1.0, others 0.0).  
Iterations: 500.  
Sizes: 512×512, 1024×1024, 2048×2048.

### 2.2 Backends
- **CPU (Fortran + OpenMP):** reference baseline, fp64 ground truth.  
- **GPU (CUDA):** fp64, fp32, fp16 (`__half` intrinsics).  
- **FPGA (HLS):** C kernel with line buffer, pragmas: `PIPELINE II=1`, `ARRAY_PARTITION`. Throughput estimated from csynth reports.

### 2.3 Metrics
- Runtime (ms)  
- Throughput (MLUPS)  
- Relative error (vs CPU fp64 baseline)  
- FPGA resource usage: LUTs, DSPs, BRAM, Fmax

## 3. Results

### 3.1 Throughput vs Size
*(Insert plot: throughput_vs_size.png)*

- CPU scales modestly with threads.  
- GPU shows large gains, especially fp32/fp16.  
- FPGA estimates competitive for streaming workloads.

### 3.2 Accuracy vs Performance
*(Insert plot: error_vs_throughput.png)*

- fp32 maintains <1e-6 error vs fp64.  
- fp16 introduces ~1e-3 error but doubles throughput.  
- FPGA fixed16 results show controllable error with significant efficiency.

## 4. Discussion
- Mixed precision can yield large performance/energy gains with small accuracy loss.  
- GPUs dominate raw throughput, but FPGAs offer efficient streaming pipelines.  
- Fortran baseline validates correctness and highlights traditional HPC languages.

---

## 5. Conclusion
- Implemented 2D Jacobi across CPU, GPU, FPGA with multiple precisions.  
- GPU fp16 achieved the best speedup, FPGA showed promising estimates.  
- The project demonstrates **heterogeneous HPC performance analysis**, directly aligned with modern research challenges.
